                        Cole and his wife (also a teacher) live in a sunny apartment near Lake Merritt where he hosts students and their parents.  He prefers to work in person, especially for the first few sessions, but he also conferences with students through Skype and edits through Google Docs.

                    <p>
                        The initial meeting is spent discussing the essay prompt(s), the student's goals, and helping the student discover an impressive topic that he or she is passionate about. Every student has countless fantastic essay topics just waiting to be typed out!  The key is to match the right topic and tone with the right school. Stanford and Berkeley, for example, are looking for different qualities in an applicant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsequent meetings are spent revising, and eventually polishing, a student's essay until each and every sentence is a perfect combination of aesthetics and functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cole has coached over a thousand students through the college application process.  He continues to be genuinely interested in discovering and displaying a student's passions--and challenges. Colleges want to admit honest and well-rounded students. They are looking for "the real you," not just an invincible version of yourself. Cole will work with you until your personal statement is the best thing you've ever written.

                        Cole works with students (if time allows) from the initial brainstorming stage through the final revision.  If time does not allow, Cole recommends the bolded (and most essential) steps.

                        (Steps 1 and 2 can usually be completed through Skype in an hour or less.)

                        <p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Step 3:</strong>  Discuss and discover evidence to support the student’s topic sentences. This step is usually completed by the student as homework.

                        <p>

                                        Q: How many sessions does it take to complete one 500-word essay?
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        A: It depends on many factors. Cole recommends multiple revisions (and even multiple editors).  A great personal statement takes time.  Many students submit a personal statement that is less than their best effort because they skip the necessary revisions and/or write their essays at the last moment.
                                    </li>

                                        Absolutely not. Your original words and thoughts are far more unique, interesting, and desireable than those of the tutor. ​
